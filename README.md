git clone https://github.com/your-username/stopwatch.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd stopwatch
Open index.html in your browser:

🧠 How It Works
JavaScript handles the stopwatch logic by using setInterval to increment the time.

Buttons are tied to functions:

start() begins the timer

stop() pauses the timer

reset() resets the time to 00:00:00

🖌️ Customization
You can easily customize the look and feel by modifying style.css, or add additional features like lap timing or save history.
