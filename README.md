## ⏱️ Stopwatch Web App
A simple, responsive stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app lets you start, stop, and reset a timer with ease — all from your browser.

## 🚀 Live Demo
You can try it live here: Live Demo Link https://stopwatch-3zhc.onrender.com

## 🛠️ Features
- ⏯️ Start, Stop, and Reset the stopwatch
- 🖥️ Clean and minimal user interface
- 📱 Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## 📂 Project Structure
├── index.html       # Main HTML file <br>
├── style.css        # Styling for the stopwatch <br>
└── script.js        # Stopwatch logic using JavaScript <br>

## 📦 Getting Started
- Clone the repository : git clone https://github.com/your-username/stopwatch.git
- Navigate to the project directory : cd stopwatch
- Open index.html in your browser.
- Just double-click the file or open it with your favorite browser.

## 🧠 How It Works
JavaScript handles the stopwatch logic by using setInterval to increment the time.
Buttons are tied to functions:
- start() begins the timer
- stop() pauses the timer
- reset() resets the time to 00:00:00

## 🖌️ Customization
You can easily customize the look and feel by modifying style.css, or add additional features like lap timing or save history.
